# Anon

This is a simple social media application built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Setup Firebase Realtime Database
Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and click 'Add a project'. Go to your project settings and click 'Add Firebase to your web app'. Copy only the values in the config object to use later.

## To run locally

Run the command `git clone https://github.com/alDuncanson/anon.git`. Now, paste the values you copied earlier into the `firebaseConfig.js` file. Now your database is all set. Open a terminal and move into the directory `cd anon`. Then run `npm i` followed by `npm start` and your default browser should spin up the application on localhost.
