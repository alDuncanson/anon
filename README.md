# Anon

This is a simple social media application built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), using [Firebase's Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/), and hosted using continuous integration with [Netlify}(https://www.netlify.com/).

## To run locally

Open a terminal and run the command `git clone https://github.com/alDuncanson/anon.git`. Move into the directory `cd anon`. Then run `npm i` followed by `npm start` and your default browser should spin up the application on localhost.
